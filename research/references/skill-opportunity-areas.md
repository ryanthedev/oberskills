# Skill Opportunity Areas

> **Purpose:** Ideas for high-value skills that don't yet exist
> **Load when:** Looking for skill creation inspiration

## Overview

These are gaps identified in the skill ecosystem where new skills would provide high value.

## Opportunity Matrix

| Skill Idea | Problem Solved | Why It's a Skill | Core Components |
|------------|----------------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Database Administration** | Claude writes SQL but lacks schema design, migration, performance tuning methodology | Procedural "how to approach" knowledge | Schema normalization trees, index optimization flows, migration checklists |
| **Accessibility Testing** | No systematic a11y workflow; Claude checks elements individually | WCAG audit methodology | WCAG 2.1 checklist, screen reader guidance, contrast decisions, semantic HTML patterns |
| **API Design** | Inconsistent REST/GraphQL patterns, no versioning strategy | Encodes organizational API standards | RESTful naming, error standards, versioning tree, OpenAPI generation |
| **Incident Response** | No production incident workflow (triage → communication → RCA → postmortem) | Multi-phase workflow with handoffs | Severity matrix, communication templates, RCA methodology, postmortem structure |
| **Code Review** | Claude reviews code but lacks systematic methodology per review type | Procedural "how to review" knowledge | Review type routing, severity classification, feedback templates, language checklists |
| **Data Pipeline Design** | ETL/ELT workflow gaps, data validation, monitoring patterns | Systematic data engineering decisions | Batch vs streaming tree, validation frameworks, idempotency, alerting setup |
| **Technical Writing** | Documentation beyond READMEs (API docs, ADRs, runbooks) | Different doc types need different structures | Doc type routing, audience analysis, templates, diagramming, versioning |
| **Contract/Policy Analysis** | Legal review, compliance checking, risk identification | Systematic document analysis methodology | Clause identification, risk flagging, compliance checklists, summary structure |
| **Performance Profiling** | Profiler interpretation, bottleneck identification, optimization priority | How to interpret profiler output | Profiler selection, metric interpretation, optimization trees, before/after validation |
| **Localization Workflow** | No i18n/l10n skills (string extraction, translation management) | Multi-step workflow with quality validation | String extraction patterns, translation formats, pluralization, locale formatting |

## Selection Criteria for New Skills

Before creating any of these:

| Question | Required Answer |
|----------|-----------------|
| Has this been done 5+ times? | Yes |
| Will it be done 10+ more? | Yes |
| Can it be taught through documentation? | Yes |
| Does Claude lack this capability natively? | Yes |
| Is the scope describable in one sentence without "and"? | Yes |
